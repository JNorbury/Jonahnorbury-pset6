Final App project "Plantt" for the course "Native App Studio", 
University of Amsterdam (UvA), 16-12-2016.

Created with love by Jonah Norbury, 10742891.

## Introduction
### Requirements
The native android app within this repository is for Android API 15 and above.
An internet connection is required for full usage of the app.

### Purpose
The following app was made as a part of the minor in Programming of the UvA.
During week two of the app, a peer review assessment was undergone to ensure
the app lives up to the standards as given on
https://appsf.mprog.nl/psets/your-own as of 16-12-16.

### Why?
Everyone has plants, everyone forgets to water them.

Further, the name is short enough to withstand the modification.

### What does it do?
The app bases on allowing users to use the wiki open-api for the purpose
of implementing restful JSON through asynctasks, which allows very specific data
to be requested at an .
